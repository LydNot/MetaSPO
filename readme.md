🚀 **Welcome to the official repository of** [**System Prompt Optimization with Meta-Learning**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09666)!

## 🔍 Overview
![MetaSPO](asset/main_fig.jpg)
This repository contains the official implementation of Meta-level System Prompt Optimizer (MetaSPO), a meta-learning approach for optimizing system prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs). MetaSPO is designed to optimize system prompts that are robust to diverse user inputs and transferable across a wide range of tasks and domains.

## 📌 Get Started
### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dozi01/MetaSPO.git
cd MetaSPO
conda create -n metaspo python=3.10 -y
conda activate metaspo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Ensure your OPENAI_API_KEY is stored in the .env file.

### MetaSPO: Training and Evaluation
```bash
./main.sh
```
Refer to `main.sh` for detailed instructions.

### Tasks
Modify `configs/$DOMAIN.yaml` to set dataset configurations.  
To implement new tasks, include the task name in `srt/tasks/__init__.py` and implement a corresponding task class.
